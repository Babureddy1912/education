						<p>block-level summary of contents from another source</p>
						<div epub:type="abstract"><p>Dave Isay, the founder of StoryCorps and the editor of
									<cite>Listening Is an Act of Love</cite>, shares the experiences that led him to
								begin the StoryCorps project in his essay “<cite>The Story of StoryCorps</cite>.” One
								of the experiences involved his showing homeless and near-homeless men who live on the
								lower East Side of New York City some pages of a soon-to-be-published book that
								feature photographs of them and the text of their oral histories. Isay writes:</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p>One of the men looked at his story, took it in his hands, and literally danced
									through the halls of the hotel shouting, “I exist! I exist!” I was stunned. I
									realized as never before how many people among us feel completely invisible,
									believe their lives don’t matter, and fear they’ll someday be forgotten.</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p class="continued">Isay’s experience with this man, who had never before felt that he
								existed in the larger world, who felt that he could live or die with no impact, speaks
								to the undertaking that is StoryCorps. StoryCorps is an oral history project that
								spans the breadth of the United States and records the stories of everyday people,
								from every walk of life. These oral histories are preserved in the Library of Congress
								to stand as testimonies to the people who lived and loved, dreamed and died, suffered
								and recovered during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries in America. The stories
								are real, the people are real, and the connection the reader feels is also real.</p>
							<p><cite>Listening Is an Act of Love</cite> is a collection of these voices from across
								the United States. Once you begin reading, you will have the sense that the United
								States is not just a country, but a united state of being human. Indeed, a sense of
								the universal human experience is exactly what these interviews and
								conversations—conversations that reveal stories—evoke in this collection.</p>
							<p>The book is divided into five sections that group the StoryCorps interviews by theme:
								Home and Family, Work and Dedication, Journeys, History and Struggle, and Fire and
								Water. Each of these thematic groupings reveals a cross section of the American
								experience as told by the people who have lived and are living that experience.</p>

					<p>Now that you have studied this chapter, you can do the following:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>Know what a business plan is and describe it.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p>It is a road map to success.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>It is a history and a plan for an organization.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>It must meet the needs of various audiences.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Explain the various purposes of a business plan and the audiences for it.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p>A business plan is used by entrepreneurs to organize their thoughts before
										starting a business, and to determine business viability.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>It can be used to raise money from investors and lenders. Almost always, bankers
										and other potential investors willrefuse to consider funding an entrepreneur who
										does not havea business plan.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>It can help guide the operation of the business.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Understand the components of a business plan.</p>
							<p>The parts of a business plan include a cover page; table of contents; executive
								summary; mission, vision, and culture; company description; opportunity analysis;
								marketing strategy and plan; management and operations; financial analysis and
								projections; funding request; exit strategy.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Be able to demonstrate proper development and formatting.</p>
							<p>A solid, viable business plan that is sloppy and filled with errors may be rejected on
								that basis alone. The business plan should be well organized, neatly presented, and
								written in correct English.</p>
