                        <p>One summer evening (led by her) I found</p>
                        <p>A little boat tied to a willow tree</p>
                        <p>Within a rocky cove, its usual home.</p>
                        <p>Straight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in</p>
                        <span class="num">5</span>
                        <p>Pushed from the shore. It was an act of stealth</p>
                        <p>And troubled pleasure, nor without the voice</p>
                        <p>Of mountain-echoes did my boat move on;</p>
                        <p>Leaving behind her still, on either side,</p>
                        <p>Small circles glittering idly in the moon,</p>
                        <span class="num">10</span>
                        <p>Until they melted all into one track</p>
                        <p>Of sparkling light. But now, like one who rows,</p>
                        <p>Proud of his skill, to reach a chosen point</p>
                        <p>With an unswerving line, I fixed my view</p>
                        <p>Upon the summit of a craggy ridge,</p>
                        <span class="num">15</span>
                        <p>The horizon&#39;s utmost boundary; far above</p>
                        <p>Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.</p>
                        <p>She was an <a id="glossref01" href="#def01" epub:type="glossref">elfin</a> <a id="glossref02" href="#def02" epub:type="glossref">pinnace</a>; lustily</p>
                        <p>I dipped my oars into the silent lake,</p>
                        <p>And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat</p>
                        <span class="num">20</span>
                        <p>Went heaving through the water like a swan;</p>
                        <p>When, from behind that craggy steep till then</p>
                        <p>The horizon&#39;s bound, a huge peak, black and huge,</p>
                        <p><a id="glossref03" href="#def03" epub:type="glossref">As if with voluntary power instinct</a>,</p>
                        <p>Upreared its head. I struck and struck again,</p>
                        <span class="num">25</span>
                        <p>And growing still in stature the grim shape</p>
                        <p>Towered up between me and the stars, and still,</p>
                        <p>For so it seemed, with purpose of its own</p>
                        <p>And measured motion like a living thing,</p>
                        <p>Strode after me. With trembling oars I turned,</p>
                        <span class="num">30</span>
                        <p>And through the silent water stole my way</p>
                        <p>Back to the covert of the willow tree;</p>
                        <p>There in her mooring-place I left my <a id="glossref04" href="#def04" epub:type="glossref">bark</a>, &#8211;</p>
                        <p>And through the meadows homeward went, in grave</p>
                        <p>And serious mood; but after I had seen</p>
                        <span class="num">35</span>
                        <p>That spectacle, for many days, my brain</p>
                        <p>Worked with a dim and <a id="glossref05" href="#def05" epub:type="glossref">undetermined</a> sense</p>
                        <p>Of unknown modes of being; o&#39;er my thoughts</p>
                        <p>There hung a darkness, call it solitude</p>
                        <p>Or blank desertion. No familiar shapes</p>
                        <span class="num">40</span>
                        <p>Remained, no pleasant images of trees,</p>
                        <p>Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields;</p>
                        <p>But huge and mighty forms, that do not live</p>
                        <p>Like living men, moved slowly through the mind</p>
                        <p>By day, and were a trouble to my dreams.</p>

                                <p>William Wordsworth (1770&#8211;1850) was one of the first writers whose work was labelled as &#8216;Romantic&#8217;. Much of his poetry is about humanity&#39;s relationship with nature, inspired by the English Lake District, where he spent most of his life. The Romantic poets helped change how people thought about the natural world. They believed that mankind does not control nature; it&#39;s the other way round. This extract is from Wordsworth&#39;s long autobiographical poem &#8216;The Prelude&#8217;, which was not published until after his death. In the extract, the poet is &#8216;led by her&#8217;&#8211; that is, by nature &#8211; to the experience he describes.</p>

                    <p>This passage from &#8216;The Prelude&#8217; comes just before the section on stealing the boat:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="charis">How strange that all</p>
                        <p class="charist">The terrors, pains, and early miseries,</p>
                        <p class="charist">Regrets, vexations, lassitudes interfused</p>
                        <p class="charist">Within my mind, should e&#39;er have borne a part,</p>
                        <p class="charist">And that a needful part, in making up</p>
                        <p class="charist">The calm existence that is mine when I</p>
                        <p class="charist">Am worthy of myself! Praise to the end!</p>
                        <p class="charist">Thanks to the means which Nature deigned to employ;</p>
                        <p class="charist">Whether her fearless visitings, or those</p>
                        <p class="charist">That came with soft alarm, like hurtless light</p>
                        <p class="charist">Opening the peaceful clouds; or she may use</p>
                        <p class="charist">Severer interventions, ministry</p>
                        <p class="charist">More palpable, as best might suit her aim.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Wordsworth is implying that &#8216;Nature&#8217; was trying to teach him a lesson, to educate him in an important way. Does this affect the way that you respond to the poem?</p>

                <p>Perhaps you have done something similar to Wordsworth &#8211; like taking a day off school, borrowing something without permission &#8230; Why not write about it in <b epub:type="keyword" class="orange">free verse</b> &#8211; or even try blank verse, like Wordsworth or Betjeman. For example:</p>
                <blockquote class="nosep">
                    <p class="andika">The day I bunked off school was hot and dry</p>
                    <p class="andika">And when I saw the sky I couldn&#39;t face</p>
                    <p class="andika">The thought of chemistry and maths. I felt</p>
                    <p class="andika">That I deserved a day to get a tan</p>
                    <p class="andika">And so I made my way &#8230;</p>
