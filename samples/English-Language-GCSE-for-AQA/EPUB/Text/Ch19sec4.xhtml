                <span class="blue uppercase">Use the passive voice</span></h2>
            <p>The passive voice is used less frequently than the active voice, but it can be a useful tool.</p>
            <p>It can shift emphasis:</p>
            <p>The teacher told the disruptive students to leave.</p>
            <div class="boxv">
                <p>Active puts emphasis on the teacher</p>
            </div>
            <p>The disruptive students were told to leave by the teacher.</p>
            <div class="boxg1">
                <p>Passive puts emphasis on the students</p>
            </div>
            <p>It can deflect blame:</p>
            <p>The governors <span epub:type="keyword" class="pink">made</span> a serious mistake.</p>
            <div class="boxr">
                <p>active</p>
            </div>
            <p>A serious mistake <span epub:type="keyword" class="skyblue">has been</span> made.</p>
            <div class="boxb">
                <p>passive</p>
            </div>
            <p>It can make something sound less aggressive:</p>
            <p>You have made no effort whatsoever with this homework.</p>
            <div class="boxo">
                <p>active = aggressive</p>
            </div>
            <p>This homework has not been done to an acceptable standard.</p>
            <div class="boxg">
                <p>passive = impartial</p>
            </div>
            <p>The passive voice is most commonly used in formal reports where the writer (or speaker) wants to distance themself from the subject:</p>
            <p class="blockquote left1em">The school is regarded highly by parents and students. Self-discipline and high levels of achievement are consistently promoted by an experienced and well-qualified teaching staff.</p>

                            <li><span>You have not paid for your ticket. (sound less aggressive)</span></li>

                        <p>Use the passive voice to write four sentences to be included in a formal report on the ICT facilities in your school.</p>
