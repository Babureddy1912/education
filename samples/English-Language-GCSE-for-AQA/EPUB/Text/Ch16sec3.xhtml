            <p>Look again at the first extract in Activity 1. The student seems to be telling a story, rather than writing a description. The only description given is of &#8216;the big clunky locks&#8217; on the gates. By not <em class="bold">describing</em>, the student was not doing what they had been asked &#8211; they were not writing for purpose.</p>
            <p>When you write something, always be clear about your purpose. Ask yourself what you are trying to achieve in your writing. You also need to know your audience &#8211; the person or people who will be reading your writing.</p>
