            <h2>Creating tone</h2> 
            <p>Look at each of the following examples and decide upon the tone being conveyed.</p>
            
            <p>Example 1</p>
            <p>Seeing that poor man stumble in the street this afternoon very nearly reduced me to tears. Sadly, I was too far away to offer assistance but was reassured to see a kind passer-by help him to his feet and escort him to the safety of the pavement.</p>

                <li><span>Which language choices suggest this?</span></li> 
            </ol>
            
            <p>Example 2</p>
            <p>I saw the man stumble in the street this afternoon. I was too far away to help but someone nearby helped him up and walked him to the kerb.</p>

            <p>Example 3</p>
            <p>Iâ€™ve never seen such a spectacle in all my life. This afternoon a drunkard staggered into oncoming traffic and miraculously managed to avoid death, though goodness knows how! Luckily for him a do-gooding passer-by gathered him up and dragged him to the pavement.</p>
