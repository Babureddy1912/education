                <p>Chris Priestley, an author, talks about why the &#8216;rules&#8217; of writing are important to know &#8211; and when it&#39;s appropriate to break them. After you watch this video, think about the example that Chris gives from his own book. Discuss with a partner whether you agree with Chris or his editor: would you repunctuate &#8216;Every. Stinking. One.&#8217;?</p>

            <p>Fragments are words or groups of words that lack the normal main clause structure of a subject and a verb, but which are used as a complete sentence. When used purposefully, fragments can enhance writing, but you should only use them when they suit the purpose.</p>
            <p>In the following extract, the writer recalls her arrival at the notorious concentration camp Auschwitz. She was 13 at the time. The fragments are underlined.</p>

            <p>The writer uses fragments effectively to:</p>
