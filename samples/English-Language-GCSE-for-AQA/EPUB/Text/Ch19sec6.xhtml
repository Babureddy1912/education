                <p>In this video, Dr Stella Peace describes how her company changes the way they advertise according to who they want to appeal to. How would you describe the difference between the tones of the two slogans she mentions: &#8216;Persil washes whiter&#8217; and &#8216;Dirt is good&#8217;?</p>

            <p>The following extract was written by a student preparing a speech for a class debate. The statement to be debated was:</p>
            <blockquote>
               <p class="bold">Teenagers today have a better life and a better future than any previous generation.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The tone is informal and sarcastic. Read it closely before examining how the chosen words create tone and manipulate the reader.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><span class="andika">I don&#39;t wish to sound <b epub:type="keyword" class="lgreen">defeatist</b>, at least not so early in my argument, but the life of teenagers these days is much as it has always been &#8211; full of rules, supposedly there to &#8216;protect&#8217; you, and restrictive regulations which do little but stunt the growth of personality and kill creativity. Dead.</span></p>
                <p><span class="andika">Let&#39;s start with school: that worthy institution sustained by a long line of governments who all went to school and, therefore, believe there is no better thing to impose on the next generation. Of course I think school&#39;s a great idea. How else would I spend my days except for sleeping, gaming, reading, socialising, exercising and generally learning more about the world around me? And what about you? What would you do if you didn&#39;t have to go to school?</span></p>
