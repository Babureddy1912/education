                    <p>The following extracts are from the writing of two students who were asked to describe a park at night.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="andika"><span class="bold">Student A</span> The children were playing in the park but some of them wanted to go home because it was getting dark but they couldn&#39;t because the gates were locked so they had to keep on playing. One of them called Katie started to cry and decided that she would try and <b epub:type="keyword" class="lgreen">climb</b> over the gates. Two of the others said that they would help her so they walked over to the gates which were very tall and had big clunky locks on them.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="andika"><span class="bold">Student B</span> Night settled reluctantly on the park, masking the trees, the bushes, the flowers and, eventually, the rough soil in a cloak of darkness. All was still. All was silent. The bustle of the day had <b  epub:type="keyword" class="lgreen">disappeared</b>. The suited bodies no longer paced the paved the paved routes. The children had long since deserted the swings. Even the drunks had abandoned their empty cans and bottles, stumbling blindly outwards at the gatekeeper&#39;s call.</p>
