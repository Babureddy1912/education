                <span class="blue uppercase">The active and passive voices</span></h2>
            <p>Most sentences have a subject, a verb and an object.</p>
            <p class="bold">The <span epub:type="keyword" class="violet">parents (subject)</span>
                <span epub:type="keyword" class="green3">liked (verb)</span> the <span epub:type="keyword" class="red">school (object)</span>.</p>
            <ul class="blue left1em">
                <li><span>The subject is the person, group or thing doing the action: &#8216;The parents&#8217;.</span></li>
                <li><span>The verb is the action itself: &#8216;liked&#8217;.</span></li>
                <li><span>The object is the person, group or thing that the action is done to: &#8216;the school&#8217;.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Even if the sentence is longer, the subject, verb and object remain in the same order:</p>
            <p class="bold"><span epub:type="keyword" class="violet">The parents</span>, who were visiting for the first time, <span class="green3">liked</span>
                <span epub:type="keyword" class="red">the school</span>.</p>
            <div class="boxv">
                <p>subject</p>
            </div>
            <div class="boxg1">
                <p>verb</p>
            </div>
            <div class="boxr">
                <p>object</p>
            </div>
            <p>In both these examples, &#8216;liked&#8217; is an active verb.</p>
            <p>Many verbs can be active <em class="bold">or</em> passive. When the verb is passive, the subject is on the receiving end of the action:</p>
            <p class="bold"><span epub:type="keyword" class="violet">The school</span> was <span epub:type="keyword" class="green3">liked</span> by the parents.</p>
            <div class="boxv">
                <p>subject</p>
            </div>
            <div class="boxg1">
                <p>verb</p>
            </div>
            <p>Here, the reader learns <em class="bold">what</em> is liked before learning <em class="bold">who</em> likes it. The doer (or agent) is identified using &#8216;by&#8217;: &#8216;by the parents&#8217;.</p>
            <p>However, often in passive sentences the agent is not identified, for example: &#8216;The school was well liked.&#8217; All passive forms are made up using the verb &#8216;be&#8217; + the past participle:</p>
            <p>The inspector will next consider the pupils&#8217; behaviour. <img alt="becomes" src="../Images/arrow.png" /> The pupils&#8217; behaviour will be considered next by the Inspector.</p>
            <p>The headteacher ended the meeting abruptly. <img alt="becomes" src="../Images/arrow.png" /> The meeting was ended abruptly by the headteacher.</p>
