            <p>The passive voice is generally used in objective reports where there is no evidence of the writer&#39;s feelings. Look back to the letters in Activity 2. The tone of both the letters is friendly, even though one is formal and the other informal. The word &#8216;tone&#8217; is used to describe a writer&#39;s attitude towards the subject and/or the reader. You can create many different tones in writing: serious, comic, friendly, sarcastic, sympathetic, and so on.</p>
