            <p>The writer of the letter in Activity 1 is angry. This is acceptable if you have a valid complaint. However, the writer does not bear in mind his audience &#8211; the bank manager. Generally, the less well you know your audience, the more formal your writing should be. The term register is often used to indicate the level of formality in writing.</p>
