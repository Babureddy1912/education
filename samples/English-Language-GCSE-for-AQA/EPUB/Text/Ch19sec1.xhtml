                <p>For your writing to be effective, it needs to match your purpose and audience. You may at some time need to write a letter of complaint. A letter, sent by post or emailed, can be more effective than a phone call. It can provide proof of exactly what has been said and can be used for further action if needed.</p>

                    <p>Work in pairs. Read the following letter of complaint, then use your knowledge of writing for purpose and audience to help you answer these questions.</p>
                    <blockquote class="box1">
                        <p>Dear bank manager,</p>
                        <p>I want to complain. I had to get in touch with my bank about a stupid mistake it made when it said something about me which weren&#39;t true and caused me huge problems which I don&#39;t really want to go into right now.</p>
                        <p>I rang the number on the web page and waited ages before I got some young lad on the phone who couldn&#39;t be bothered to help. He just gave me another number to ring. I waited ages &#8211; again!!! &#8211; and then rang off.</p>
                        <p>Your bank has really cheesed me off. It cost loads of money to phone and I still didn&#39;t get an answer. I could of cried. I want to know what you&#39;re going to do and how you&#39;re going to sort it all out for me.</p>
                        <p>Yours,</p>
                        <p>K. Jones</p>

                            <p epub:type="question">Normally, a letter of complaint should be written in Standard English. This is the type of English usually used in public communication and the one you are taught in school. Think about the writer&#39;s vocabulary, punctuation and grammar in the letter of complaint. What examples of non-Standard English can you identify?</p>
