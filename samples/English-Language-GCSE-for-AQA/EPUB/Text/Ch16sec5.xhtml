                <span class="blue uppercase">Vary sentence structures</span></h3>
            <p>A good writer varies sentence structure to influence the reader. To do this successfully, you need to understand the basics of sentence structure.</p>
            <p>At its simplest, a sentence contains one main clause, which has a subject and a finite verb:</p>
            <p class="image"><a id="r57" href="Realia_page134-001.xhtml"><img alt="Subject and verb identified" src="../Images/img109.jpg" /></a></p>
            <p>A simple sentence contains one main clause (highlighted blue in the following example). This does not mean it is always short. A simple sentence may be developed to give extra detail:</p>
            <p class="italic"><span epub:type="keyword" class="blue2">The</span> five suspected <span epub:type="keyword" class="blue2">culprits hesitated</span> outside the open door of the headteacher&#39;s study.</p>
            <p>A compound sentence contains two or more main clauses (highlighted blue) linked by the coordinating conjunctions &#8216;and&#8217;, &#8216;or&#8217; or &#8216;but&#8217; (highlighted yellow):</p>
            <p class="italic"><span class="blue2">The culprits hesitated</span>
                    <span class="yellow1">but</span>
                    <span class="blue2">they knew there was no escape.</span></p>
            <p class="italic"><span class="blue2">The culprits hesitated</span>
                    <span class="yellow1">but</span>
                    <span class="blue2">they knew their time was up</span>
                    <span class="yellow1">and</span>
                    <span class="blue2">they shuffled into the study.</span></p>

                <h4><span class="backb uppercase">Activity 5</span></h4>
                <p>Stories for young children often contain simple sentences so that they are easy to follow.</p>
                <ol class="nomark">
                    <li epub:type="general-problem">
                        <p><span class="icon_color_ball icon_base_smaller">1</span></p>
                        <p epub:type="question">Write five simple sentences to start a story for young children. Your subject could be: the lonely dragon; adventure in the forest; the slimy slug; or something of your own choosing.</p>

                    <li epub:type="general-problem">
                        <p><span class="icon_color_ball icon_base_smaller">2</span></p>

                    </li>
                    <li epub:type="general-problem">
                        <p><span class="icon_color_ball icon_base_smaller">3</span></p>
                        <p epub:type="question">Choose two of your sentences and develop each of them into a compound sentence.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li epub:type="general-problem">
                        <p><span class="icon_color_ball icon_base_smaller">4</span></p>
                        <p epub:type="question">Highlight the main clauses and the coordinating conjunctions in your two compound sentences.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>A complex sentence contains at least one main clause (highlighted blue in the following example) and one subordinate clause (highlighted green). The subordinate clause also contains a subject and a verb, but it cannot stand as a sentence on its own; it depends on the main clause to give it complete meaning:</p>
                <p class="image"><a id="r58" href="Realia_page134-002.xhtml"><img alt="Subordinating conjunction followed by main clause" src="../Images/img112.jpg" /></a></p>
                <p>This could work equally well the other way round:</p>
                <p class="image"><a id="r59" href="Realia_page134-003.xhtml"><img alt="Main clause followed by subordinating conjunction" src="../Images/img113.jpg" /></a></p>
                <p>In this example, the two clauses are linked by the subordinating conjunction &#8216;although&#8217;. Common subordinating conjunctions are &#8216;although&#8217;, &#8216;if&#8217;, &#8216;while&#8217;, &#8216;when&#8217;, &#8216;since&#8217;, &#8216;until&#8217;, &#8216;after&#8217;. The subordinating conjunction is usually placed before the subordinate clause. Notice how the comma is used to separate the clauses.</p>
